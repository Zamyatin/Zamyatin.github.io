      <p>Feedback and Pairing</p>

      <p>To be quite honest, I can't *wait* to get into DBC campus down in the loop.  Just about every pairing session I've had thus far has left me walking away with at least one or two incredibly helpful discoveries/takeaways/shared experiences.  More importantly, they act as a reprieve from sitting alone in my house staring at the screen, stuck on a problem or Challenge that I <em>know</em> will have a very simple solution, once I figure out the method and the syntax.  I love learning with people, and most the time they seem to be agreeable with my thought process and methods to break down a problem, describe it, or create allusions to other things that are generally more tangible (for example saying: "Oh! This is like this kind of problem in real life! Well this is how I think about it irl, hw can we make that magic happen in code?")</p>

      <p>That being said, I have definitely had a pretty wide array of experiences, in terms of successfully completing Challenges, with the pairings I've had.  Sometimes the pairings have felt less driver/navigator style and more collaborative.  At other times, we tried very hard to stick to the driver/navigator style.  There's a value to both.  In my experience thus far, the collaborative style is best when trying to explain <em>how something works</em> - which is a place I love to be in a group environment.  I learn very fast when we're effectively describing a tool and hw it's used - ideas on employing that tool in past Challenges or future projects start poppin' like popcorn. :)</p>

      <p>The Driver/Navigator style, though, is proving *far* more efficient when it comes to actually <em>getting something done</em>, which of course, is the Ruby way to begin with.  Challenges have gotten done faster or more completely using Driver/Navigator than when using collaboration - the latter had a tendency to digress into sidebar conversations about <em>ideas</em>.  Ideas are fine, but let's be honest, nobody wants to work on a challenge for longer than a few hours. </p>

      <p>So far as Feedback goes - I feel we are all still strangers and are trying to be as kind and gentle as possible.  I know I've gone out of my way to "soften the blow" of a criticism when offering feedback, and trying to describe the way to fix it in an actionable sense really does help in that regard.  I'd rather tell someone "Hey, try to avoid doing <em>x</em>try <em>y</em>intead".  Since we've all been prepped for receiving feedback and dealing with it, I think in most cases I haven't seen someone get overly defensive. </p>

      <p>Based on the feedback I've received thus far, I believe I should keep focusing on the things that people have given kind words to: my ability to break down problems into understandable chunks, my ability to describe a path to a solution, and my ability to ask for input when we're really stuck.  Things that I want to work on include long-term focus and avoiding dragging people into my experimental hell when I get stuck on a problem.  Apparently other people can figure things out without experimenting... I have no idea how.  I'm trying to figure out what they're processing, and will need to ask them how they processed some problem mentally when I see it happen again.</p>

      <p>I've also noticed that there's a certain type of person I <em>prefer</em>to work with (which isn't really a surprise) - I like calm, focused people, but I prefer ones that are also willing to make jokes and be a little chatty while we're processing a problem.  I do NOT like it when someone goes totally silent (which has happened in the recent past), then suddenly whip out some miracle code that works the way we wanted.  When it happens, I feel dumb. Dumb for talking it out loud and dumb for not "getting" it the way that person did.  I also feel looked down upon.  I am pretty sure that wasn't the person's intention, and I'm fairly sure it was just a personality trait that this person is obviously far more of an individually thinker and concrete person than I am, but man, I walked away feeling like a joke. </p>

      <p>I'm a pretty open and easygoing person, so writing feedback is not hard for me.  I suppose what's most difficult is trying to keep it <em>anonymous</em>.  Normally I want to cite some crazy story or absurd joke we came up with as we were writing our code (which inevitably leads to very silly variable names), but we're supposed to keep those specifics out of the conversation. Ugh! That's half the fun and at least a quarter of my "Zaz!". </p>

      <p>Ultimately, I'm really looking forward to get into DBC downtown.  I miss my friends (and even my enemies) at work, and I miss having people around.  Quite honestly, I'm getting very very sick of just sitting in my apartment all day struggling with code alone.  I wish I could pair more, but since I got sick a week ago I've been behind and am desperately trying to catch up now.  Hopefully I can get caught up by Tuesday and start cranking through this week's work with the rest of the class - I'm not used to being the guy that's behind.</p>
