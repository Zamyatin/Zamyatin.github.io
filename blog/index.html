      <p>Ennumerator Objects in Ruby Totally Rock!</p>

    <div id="content">
      <p>Books help.  Especially when those books tell you something you didn't know before.  In this case, life has been made WAY easier by reading Dave Thomas' "Programming Ruby", Chapter 1, where we learn how Enumerators are, just as everything else in Ruby - Happy Object Fun Time!!!</p>

    <div id="content">
      <p>I write up a bit here about CSS Positioning properties, particularly as a newbie approaching the challenge.  Clearly a struggle that soaked up an enormous amount of time, I think I got some useful ways of thinking about positioning now, and I'd like to share these thoughts with you!</p>

      <p>Chefs in the Kitchen - What the Heck have I Gotten Myself Into?</p>
      <p>September 23, 2014 - Raj Singh</p>

    <div id="content">
      <p>Part of the Culture here at DevBootCamp is.... to put it succinctly... "squishy".  They like to make us talk about our feelings and our thinking process.  They like to understand their students at, you know, a <em>human level</em>.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure how I feel about this. :)  Okay, so it's actually fascinating to kind of step back and process how I'm... processing.  Maybe it helps the learning process, maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it helps deal with the stress that is inevitably going to hit us, maybe it'll trigger it harder.  Who knows.</p>
