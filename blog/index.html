      <p>Down the Shame Spiral! To Infinity and Beyond!</p>
      <p>November 10, 2014 - Raj Singh</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>We've all been there.  You've screwed something up, and of course you think it's beyond all repair and can only lead to utter global doom, lions sleeping with bears, four dudes on horses riding down your street.  You know, real end-of-the-world type stuff... And the Shame! Oh! The Shame of it all! Do you blame yourself for your utter failure as a human being, or do you sock some random in the face for his crimes against humanity that caused you to screw up?  Do you run and hide under your covers, or do you go out and tear it up like every day just turned into an <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xmckWVPRaI"> Twisted Sister</a> video? <em>That</em> my dear readers, is the Shame Spiral. How do you deal? </p>

      <p>I've had some experience writing good and bad SQL code in the past. Here's my first attempt to align software and hardware in the minds of a SQL coder! Hopefully, it'll open up the young developer's eyes to performance when dealing with millions of rows of data! </p>

      <p>We've probably beaten this topic to death at DBC, but I suppose the teachers want to know how we feel about our pairing experiences. Mine have been almost 100% positive, and have been at worst a pleasurable reprieve from coding alone.  I NEED some people around me soon!</p>

      <p>Books help.  Especially when those books tell you something you didn't know before.  In this case, life has been made WAY easier by reading Dave Thomas' "Programming Ruby", Chapter 1, where we learn how Enumerators are, just as everything else in Ruby - Happy Object Fun Time!!!</p>

      <p>I write up a bit here about CSS Positioning properties, particularly as a newbie approaching the challenge.  Clearly a struggle that soaked up an enormous amount of time, I think I got some useful ways of thinking about positioning now, and I'd like to share these thoughts with you!</p>

      <p>Chefs in the Kitchen - What the Heck have I Gotten Myself Into?</p>
      <p>September 23, 2014 - Raj Singh</p>
    </div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>Part of the Culture here at DevBootCamp is.... to put it succinctly... "squishy".  They like to make us talk about our feelings and our thinking process.  They like to understand their students at, you know, a <em>human level</em>.</p>
      <p>I'm not sure how I feel about this. :)  Okay, so it's actually fascinating to kind of step back and process how I'm... processing.  Maybe it helps the learning process, maybe it doesn't.  Maybe it helps deal with the stress that is inevitably going to hit us, maybe it'll trigger it harder.  Who knows.</p>
