      <p>October 1, 2014 - Raj Singh</p>

    <div id="content">
      <p>I write up a bit here about CSS Positioning properties, particularly as a newbie approaching the challenge.  Clearly a struggle that soaked up an enormous amount of time, I think I got some useful ways of thinking about positioning now, and I'd like to share these thoughts with you!</p>

      <p>Chefs in the Kitchen - What the Heck have I Gotten Myself Into?</p>

      <p>Part of the Culture here at DevBootCamp is.... to put it succinctly... "squishy".  They like to make us talk about our feelings and our thinking process.  They like to understand their students at, you know, a <em>human level</em>.</p>
