			<p>Down the Shame Spiral! To Infinity and Beyond!</p>

			<p>I'd have to say that sometime midway through grad school about the time I started feeling the true impact of shame spirals.  It's funny that some of the first words I remember about the experience I would have in grad school were as a retort to my optimism over the next two years: "Yeah, we'll squeeze that out of you soon enough."  Truer words have never been spoken.  Grad school for most students is a far more conscious choice than undergrad - you've gone through the four years once, you've jumped around and experienced a million new things, and you've probably had your share of folly in the post-undergrad work force.  Grad school is that moment when you're actually tying a decision to a long-term commitment (in this particular case, one bound in an arcane tradition and indentured servitude to someone who, if you're good, has even <em>less</em> reason to graduate you).  Sure, I'm having a bit of fun here, but the point stands:  When you have something on the line, and a huge reason you're in the situation you are is because you chose to put yourself there, *and* when you start tying thoughts that your entire future is contingent on success in this deed, you're just asking for trouble.  Think about it: If you positon your entire future contingent on success on one thing, you're essentially triggering the natural fight or flight mechanism.</p>
			<p> Obviously we've all faced harsh realities and emotional conflict as adults.  As part of DBC's mission we aren't taught to avoid emotional conflict, or for that matter any elements of the human condition, but we are told to be *aware* of them.  This is the part where <em>understanding the emotions driving behavior</em> aren't unique to the individual. They're common. The key then, is to understand the commonalities, take a step back from the feelings that would otherwise drive our own behavior, extrapolate those feelings that drive us, and understand how they feed themselves.</p>
			<p> In the reading we were given covering the dreaded <a href="http://southdown.on.ca/publications/articles/Compass-of-Shame.pdf">"Compass of Shame"</a>, which I *think* we've already been shown (or at least some variation of it), the author suggests "Shame is supposed to be a protective response to keep us connected to the group rather than wondering off dangerously by ourselves.  It has been given to us to help us survive and to elimiated it would not be safe."  The irony is that one at least two major behavioral responses to shame are withdrawl from the group, or animosity <em>towards</em> it. The instinct, if we're to read this irony optimistically, is suppose to pass after a brief "corrective" measure that buys the individual time to re-align with the group.</p>
			<p> Now, I'm not going to go into detail about personal emotional conflicts I've had in the past - those types of issues I'm very private about.  I will, however say that I've felt a number of shame spirals even in the last 8 weeks of DBC Phase 0.  It's not easy to disassociate from the reality that we have all just quit our jobs and spent a fairly large sum of money to go back to school, and when you get confused or fall behind... separating your feelings from your behavior is more easily said than done. Personally, I've found myself retreating and becoming less social, fooling myself into believing that if I spend more time in front of the computer and away from "diversions", I'll eventually start to understand the things I get hung up on.  The reality is, I end up finding *more* ways to distract myself in front of the computer than away from it.  Some problems, I've come to learn, are just moments where holes in what I have learned are bubbling up - no amount of staring at a screen or reviewing the same inforation over and over is going to change that (at least, not with any level of efficiency).  People *are* social creatures - we live and die depending on our ability to interact, learn, and discover with others. Unfortunately, it's the same ego that drives us to identify ourselves as an individual *within* the group, that also can drive people with my personality type *away* from them. This is *especially* true during a period like Phase 0, where you effectively <em>are</em> alone, at least most of the time you spend coding.  It's why I can't wait to get into classes downtown and start "talking Ruby".  I think this feeling has been held the majority of students in DBC as well - especially in these later weeks, days before going to class.  Some people characterize it as "meeting up before the stress of DBC", others ID it as "making buddies and getting comfortable", but however they paint it, the need is there: we want to recognize the people we're going to be spending incredible numbers of hours enduring incredible stress and frustration among, before things get "rough".</p>
			<p> I will say this: Given my recent stress and slight anti-social behavior I've been at least trying to remain aware of how it's affecting the way I act around my friends.  Now, most of my friends have understood at least the basic DBC story: "I'm going away for a while. Continue to invite me to things on the offchance I'll have time to be social, but the reality is that I'm basically going to a boot camp in the very military sense.  Don't expect much social activity from me for a while."  Recently, one of my friends, who I'd recognized did *not* get this baseline through his head, began pushing really, <em>really</em> hard for my Thursday evenings for bar trivia, and Sundays for football.  It came to the point where he would show up in the alley of my apartment building screaming outside my window (obivously he'd been out watching the morning game), basically trying to guilt me into leaving my homework and coming out.  He'd make claims that somehow my *not* going to the bar on a Sunday morning was "unhealthy" and anti-social, and that "all he wants to tell me is that my friends want to see me".  Yes, classic guilt trip. Funny thing, I'd just found myself hanging out with more of my tech oriented friends lately, talking Ruby as much as I could, HTML, JS, video game design concepts, etc.  It's not that I was becoming entirely entrenched in anti-social behavior so much as I'd chosen to re-align my time with people that just... well, shared some things more in common at the time.  By the time my friend showed up in the alley I'd already received at least 30 texts from him, his girlfriend, and a few other people in the group chat.  The interesting thing was that after I'd explained how much work I had ahead of me (and that I was trying to get it done by midnight that night), most of them understood. The fact that he didn't made me *furious*. I don't get furious. At least, not often. Not to the point I was this time. </p>
			<p> What was cool, though, was that I actually *remembered* what I'd been reading from DBC.  Upon realzing what was going on in the alley, I took a moment, put on my shoes and my jacket, stood in the kitchen for a moment and took a few deep breaths. There's only so much you can do to hide "furious", and honestly I had no intention of hiding it. What I *did* want to avoid was getting emotional. Instead, I'd explain to him very shortly what work was ahead of me, then ask him if he understands that.  I actually explained to him that yes, I've been a bit antisocial lately, and yes, my interests have shifted a bit. Yes, I was stressed, yes I was reacting to that stress in a certain way.  I assured him I was aware of how it was affecting me, but how did he think his actions were helping the situation?</p>
			<p>It was a moment, I've gotta say.  It shut down his incredible level of obnoxiousness, I was able to maintain authority by *not* blowing my top, and really, being able to deal with a confrontation at a higher level felt pretty good!  In the end, He's stopped the obnoxious demands, and we've had a bit more grown-up method for making plans. More importantly, at least for a moment, the feeling of dread I'd been dealing with left me.  I'd accomplished something I wasn't normally successful at: confrontation at a point when I'd gotten *that* angry.  Typically, that person would be out of my life for at least a year, this time we came to a modicum of understanding.  Also, it was a total Kung Fu moment. :) </p>
