    	<p>Beginner Level SQL Optimization Techniques</p>
			<p>November 10, 2014 - Raj Singh</p>

    	<p>I guess the closes thing I've done to programming, at least in a professional environment prior to DBC was done in SQL.  I'd had the good fortune of working with a DBD (Database Developer) named Susan, who'd taken me under her wing when she realized my eagerness to learn the SQL language.  I found understanding databases extremely useful as I began supporting our ERP system and our Service Reporting application system at work, and honestly, databases are just FUN!  There's a sense of immediate gratification when you know you're going through hundreds of thousands of records, and with a few well-chosen lines of code,  you're pulling up exactly what you want to see almost immediately.  Management appreciates the knowledge too, as they like to get quick answers and "high level views" of common occurences, without muddling through the little stuff.  <em>That</em>, to me, is the power of databases.  The thing is, as you start to write larger and larger queries, as you start swapping tables, creating views, and setting timed daily and weekly database updates - often ones that start at midnight and run for a solid 4-6 hours, processing millions of transactions a night - you'll quickly learn that the "immediate gratification" you had when first learning SQL become more and more a thing of the past.</p>
			<p>Enter SQL Query optimization.</p>
			<p>The fact of the matter is, while we recognize that computers are really <em>really</em> good at doing repetitive tasks over and over again, there is a limit to how many of those tasks they can do within a time frame.  Processors can do a set number of calucations per second, hard drives can only read/write so fast, RAM (where data loads into *before* writing to the hard drive) is not infinite.  The key to understanding what SQL Optimization <em>means</em>, then, is to understand *what* you're asking of your database server, and *how* it's going to process your requests!</p>
			<p>I'd like to briefly put a few key notions into your head as we think about the relationship between hardware and software:
				<ul>
					<li>Reduce those repetitive tasks to as few as you can! This reduces processor cycles on one query when it could be using those cycles for other queries at the same time!</li>
					<li>Try to avoid loading *too much information* into memory before the system as a chance to purge that data to a table. This reduces RAM usage, and leaves space in RAM open for other concurrent SQL processes.</li>
					<li>Try to write code that is as *specific as possible* to the data you intend to manipulate - there's no reason to load 30 columns of data from a table 50,000 rows long, if only two columns of that data are pertinent to your query!</li>
					<li>Remember that you can create and destroy tables at will. Sometimes, creating a temporary table to run calculations against *may* be a better option than asking the computer to run loops over thousands of Rows *while* doing calculations. However, you must weight the value of single-table calculations against the cost of reading, writing, and deleting an entirely new table to the hard drive.  When you're dealing with millions of Rows of data, this will add up. (Yes, this counts even for Twitter SQL Devs - short messages don't mean small databases!)</li>
					<li>Clean data is *far* prefered to bad data. It is my opinion that data input into a databases is tightly controlled by the <em>APPLICATION</em> *before* it sees its way into a database. Don't waste SQL CPU cycles cleaning data on a daily basis, when a few simple application-level controls can optimize that data up front.</li>
					<li>Finally, remember your indexed fields!  Integers run faster than Strings when processed by SQL, and indexed fields run *far* faster than non-indexed ones.  Indexing, however, has overhead, so choose what fields you index wisely.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> In practice, unfortunately, running tests for SQL optimized code can prove to be quite difficult.  Questions such as, "Would I do better to build a new table and feed this data into it temporarily, or just run the query against this table?" are tough to answer, simply because in some cases it means testing two entirely different sets of code against one another.  Worse, the *measureable* differences are tough - tools don't really exist that measure both the amount of work the server is doing <em>and</em> the speed at which your code is running - you have to monitor these through very different (and often cryptic) applications.  Pro Tip: Make friends with your server administrators (who watch the hardware thoroughput), and your DBAs (who watch the efficacy and performance of your code).  They may be kind enough to show you the way.</p>
				<p>Without the existence of really good optimization tools (with the exception of Microsoft's SQL Developer tools - only useful for MSSQL Databases), there are of course huge lists of Tips and Tricks available on the 'Net. Lucky for you I've scoured a few, and have found a few really nice examples of Optimized Code:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>HAVING vs WHERE: In SQL, there is a significant difference in the way the database engine handles a <em>filter</em> vs a <em>query parameter</em>.</p> 
						<p>Use this:</p>
						<code>
							SELECT subject, count(subject)
							FROM student_details
							WHERE subject != 'Science'
							AND subject != 'Maths'
							GROUP BY subject; 
						</code>
						<p>Instead of this:<p>
						<code>
							SELECT subject, count(subject)
							FROM student_details
							GROUP BY subject
							HAVING subject!= 'Vancouver' AND subject!= 'Toronto';							
						</code>						
						<p> The using a WHERE clause limits returned data only once as it processes through a table.  Alternately, HAVING only filters what you see of the returned data - the larger table is still there, and to filter it, the computer must cycle through that data set <em>again</em>.  In SQL, "again" is a bad term.  You want to do things as few times as possible.</p></li>
					<li> Conditionals in WHERE statements: You want to be aware of how Boolean logic and other conditional-defining tools are processed by the computer. Strings, for example, can be looked up quicker with a wildcard than they can by specifically indicating which letters you're looking for: 
						<p>Use this:</p>
						<code>
							SELECT id, first_name, age
							FROM student_details
							WHERE first_name LIKE 'Chan%';
						</code>
						<p>Avoid this:</p>
						<code>
							SELECT id, first_name, age
							FROM student_details
							WHERE SUBSTR(first_name,1,3) = 'Cha';
						</code>
						<p> You can see in this example that the first (optimal) SQL string-search suggests that the first four letters MUST equal 'Chan' - anything after that doesn't matter.  This means SQL can do one simple scan of each Row.  In the second example, we're asking SQL to check <em>each letter independently of the search string</em>, which means SQL will start processing each Row by scanning the string and verifying the first letter, then the second letter, then the third letter (for 'Cha')- we've now tripled our query time, and are getting less letters scanned!</p>
					</li> 
					<li> The NOT operator: Try to avoid negative operators in general.  It is much quicker for SQL to prove something TRUE (the query must fit only specific constraints), than it does to something that it must prove NOT TRUE (tons of variations can exist that it must check against).</li>
					<li>COUNT vs EXIST: When writing a query that checks whether a particular value exists anywhere in a field, I have seen COUNT used extensively.  The problem is, COUNT will actually run through an entire data table and only return a value (true or false, whether the value exists or not) <em>after</em> it has run through the entire table.  Alternately, EXIST will stop upon recognition of the first instance of that value.  This is huge, especially in data tables containing millions of Rows, when that value exists in, say, the fifth Row.  Why ask the computer to check millions of Rows when it can stop at Row five?</li>
					<li>INDEX Unique Columns: Databases are in some ways like a textbook. It's easier to find helpful tips in textbooks when those books have an index with topics and page numbers, right?  Well, a database thinks the same way!  INDEXES are files held internally to the database engine that hold rapid, on-the-spot locational information for certain types of data - when a database can check its index for information, it avoids having to "re-read the book", and cycle through millions of Rows of data.  However, indexing data is vastly more beneficial when that data is <em>unique</em> on each row (an email address, for example, will be unique to each user so long as EVERY USER is required to enter an email address, and that the application verifies the email address *is* unique upon user registration).  Also, bear in mind that over-indexing creates overhead for the SQL Database engine, eating up RAM (indexes are generally stored in RAM), or "polluting" the index environment - index only what you think is best.</li>
					<li>Primary Indexing: Remember that Integers are set values, and far more quickly scanned by SQL than Strings are.  Generally, short integer IDs are going to serve better for indexed fields than string fields (i.e. the aforementioned email index).  When using Strings as Indexed fields, it's best to try to keep those strings as short as possible: email addresses are generally shorter than home addresses, office mailstops are generally faster still.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>There are litterally *thousands* of websites with hints, tips, and tricks to writing optimized SQL code. My two primary resources were at least twice this long (each), and written in fairly poor english. :)  My hope here was not to build a comprehensive listing of tips for Code Optimization, so much as to point your attention to *how* a computer processes your code, and how you can be aware of what you're asking it to do - like a good manager, if you request well-defined tasks, you're going to get a better (and quicker) return.</p>
