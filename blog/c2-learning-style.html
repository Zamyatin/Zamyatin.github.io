    	<p>Thinking Styles and Learning</p>
			<p>October 5, 2014 - Raj Singh</p>

    <div id="content">
			<p>After three weeks in DevBootcamp's Phase 0, there are a few things I've noticed about my processes to accomplishing tasks, and the times I learn fastest (and retain information best).  Having taken the Gregorc Thinking Style tests and read a bit about where I place (I actually place almost equally between AS, CR, and AR, with a bit of weight on AR), I actually get some conflicting reports on how I'm <em>expected</em> to learn.  Specific areas where the mapping conflicts are: learning alone vs leaning in groups or with others, analyzing (or "Pseudo-coding") before writing code vs Experimentation, following intuition vs applying logic.  </p>

			<p>In each of these cases I find myself very much using both elements - I've started to pseudo-code a bit more, writing in my code blocks a few comments on the logic I'd like to follow <em>before</em> writing the actual code (sometimes it helps, sometimes it just helps to confuse me more).  In some cases I've found that when I'm actually struggling to <em>write</em> the code, I'll go into an experimentation mode.  When it comes to learning in groups vs working alone - I'm undecided.  I certainly <em>retain</em> more information after I've explained something to someone else, but in many cases those things that I've explained are things I've already at <em>least</em> pseudo-coded, or more often actually already coded.  I have noticed that my patience for people slow on the keyboard or struggling with the vocabulary when I'm navigating can get a little thin - even as I realize that my own knowledge is far from perfect, and that as a driver I, too, sometimes struggle to process what is being asked of me.  Driving is not an easy job, and I think it just requires practice above all else.  Doing it remotely, over sometimes poor screen shares, doesn't make things easier.</p>

			<p>It seems that I'm in a perpetual state of catch-up, and I think that there are a few reasons for this, even while I said in the last blog entry that I felt "caught up": </p>

			<p>First, I believe I struggle with categorizing the weekly assignments as they are arranged and presented to us.  I <em>always</em> find random little "gotchas" in the assignments - things that I feel would be better identified in an organized, date-relative syllabus, in <strong>outline</strong> form.  I'm actually re-outlining the syllabus for Unit 2 as I write this (I flip between tasks when I get bored).</p>

			<p>Second, I get competitive <em>with the tasks</em> - meaning, I don't like to be beaten by a challenge. In many cases I've sat at the desk for 8 hours banging away at various attempts to solve challenges or problems, and found that eventually I just fall asleep in the chair.  I've lately tried to "step away" from problems for a bit, shake my mind up with some other job/duty/task, or just go visit some friends... sometimes, just taking a nap is called for.  When I return to the problem, lo-and-behold I've got a random idea of a super-simple solution.  I guess I have a tendency to over-think things - this is what I'm saying.</p>

			<p>Finally, when time becomes a pressure, I will push hard through 95% of it, then completely duck-and-cover and withdraw that final push didn't finish the job.  This has become <em>exceptionally</em> annoying because I <em>plan</em> that final push - and inevitably there's some sneaky "gotcha" in the assignment, which is going to take far more time than the original outline indicated.  Hence, I'm re-writing every syllabus from here on out.  I HATE getting caught with large jobs wrapped in seemingly small ones. HATE IT.</p>

			<p>Bottom line is, here's how I've organized my thinking process thus far:</p>

			<ol>
			<li><p>Pseudo-coding works.  Don't need to do it for everything, but it helps on the things that have a few logical steps in a row.</p></li>
			<li><p>I love the research element to finding problems. This is when I'm best on my own - I will read page after page for "how things work" because I like to understand not only <em>that</em> something works, but also <em>why</em> it works and <em>how</em> it came to be.  <strong>Per a suggestion from one of the other Boots, this is something best done at night, when time slows down and you don't feel pressured to get things done</strong>.  Not a bad bit of advice.</p></li>
			<li><p>I find pairing best when I already have a general idea of the process I'd like to accomplish.  I've not run into a pair yet where we <em>really</em> had to struggle over a problem, but I feel that I'd rather be sitting next to that individual when facing these problems, than trying to do it remotely.  The remote pairing element is far less than expedient, and the tools aren't there yet.  I've started looking for some kind of Google Hangouts coding app.  I found a few: <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/08/new-google-extension-adds-real-time-document-collaboration-to-hangouts/">a Free? coding app in Hangouts</a>, and <a href="https://floobits.com/">Floobits</a>, which costs some money as a monthly service, but looks frigging amazing!!!  It hooks into Sublime as well, so you can collaborate in Sublime or on the web in real-time.  Amazing.  These are the kinds of apps I want to write someday! :)</p></li>
			<li><p>I tend to be an intuitive thinker, and I definitely think in "chunks" more than "linearly".  This is probably why I find coding so calming... I can think in chunks and then start putting those chunks into linear processes, and see results.  For me, it's a form of catharsis.</p></li>
			<li><p>I need breaks, and should be willing to pull myself away from a challenge without feeling "beaten" by it.</p></li>
