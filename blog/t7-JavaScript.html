    	<p>Javascript - Awesomeness wrapped up in a Syntax Migrane</p>

    	<p> Oh. My. God.  So.... how was my experience learning JS this week after 4 weeks of solid Ruby...?  Well, first off I'll restate what I wrote up in some of my reflections: going on a crash course learning a language that is both very much the same and very much different than another at the rate we're learning them in DBC is reminiscent of my return to the USA after a year in France - I feel like both my languages are broken now, and basically I'll be communicating with a complex series of grunts, points, and nods until I learn to compartmentalize and disseminate.  I'm sure my Ruby is boned for at least a week. I'm sure my JS looks like Ruby (bad Ruby, not "eloquent Ruby").  I AM THE ANDREW W.K. OF PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES!!!</p>
			<p> That being said, I *also* believe that as I *do* learn to disseminate and categorize styles in these languages (as I have been all week) I think my take-away will be for the better.  It's hard to get a really concrete understanding of why one language works the way it does (which involved design desicions, speed, limitations, and style preferences, among other things), until you really start to dig into a second language.  Now, I'm realizing that there *are* oddities and limits to writing clean Ruby just as there are in JS.  JS is designed with web developers in mind (HTML/CSS style devs, not web app devs), and at least in my opinion that fact shows itself very clearly in the way JS handles properties of objects. OH MY GOD THE PROPERTIES!  I love it. So, SO easy to call, SO easy to modify, SUCH a pain in the butt when you start overwriting other functions that you've written or randomly use a friendly name for a variable that unwittingly overwrites a whole chunk of core functionality (been there, done that, will do it again I'm sure).  Still, I love properties. I'm going to build spaceships with them. LOTS of spaceships.  I never got so comfortable with arrays in Ruby as I did in JS, for no reason other than that the syntactical logic just seems a bit more straightforward.  Ruby is easier to write *what* you want it to do, but JS seemed easier to just *do it*.  Not sure why. My guess is that I'd just started really getting a grasp on arrays in Ruby when I jumped over to JS.  Hashes in Ruby - awesome, but nothing compared to the simplicity of JS properties.</p>
			<p> OK. Enough with singing JS's praises. I do get the sense that between JS properties and Ruby Hashes, we'll be using a LOT more JS properties - hashes are kind of... specific to the situation, and I feel like Rails, JSON, and SQL would fill in a number of the uses we'd otherwise be using in Ruby.  Dealing with JS properties gives you that sense of immediate satisfaction that can be oh so thrilling, when it works. When it doesn't, you're left hunting for a ridiculous parenthesis or semicolon that just is not an intuitive addition to the code structure (again, been there, done that, won't see those 12 hours back ever again).  Ruby on the other hand, is just easier to write complexity.  The feedback you get from rspec and ruby run is just better, the text editors are better, the IDEs are better.  At one point I was struggling so much to get simple functions to run in JS that I ended up spending hours finding a nice IDE that I could try - ended up being a really cludgy JAVA application - which didn't give me much sense of where my errors were, with the exception of a small underlined red spot.  Eventually, I realized we needed to end functions with parenthesis <em>as a rule</em> in JS - while I'd been unwittingly creating dozens of functions like I would a Ruby method: no parenthesis for arguments unless you intended to use arguments.</p>
			<p> I'm really curious now how heavily hashes will be used in Ruby development. They must have some meaning for things like JSON and XML documents - which are basically so far as I understand, modeled and structured data.  Perhaps they're used to iterate through those data sets, perhaps Rails has some tools to whip through data. I'm not sure.  What I *do* know is that I'd like to master modifying Ruby Hashes with the same ease as I did JS properties.  In terms of game development, it's just so much easier calling the object and it's property with a period(.) than relying on a method, albeit a simple one, to do the same thing.</p>
