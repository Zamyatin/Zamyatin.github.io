      <p>Thoughts on Week 1 of DevBootcamp - Git and Version Control - Why didn't I Learn This Earlier??</p>
      <p>Sept 23, 2014 - Raj Singh</p></div>
    <div id="content">
      <p>So, I should say that I'm starting to write this post on a topic I have <em>only</em> just started using (git), so please, for those non-DevBootcampers out there that happen upon these writings - don't expect any new, groundbreaking technical information.  Like, any.  At all.</p>

      <p>Actually, I think that instead of trying to cover some very, very topical understanding of Git, maybe instead I'll instead write about how I find DevBootcamp's (granted, first week) process of teaching git with my own experience self-educating and managing crises at work. Yeah, that sounds good. I imagine it'd be a much more interesting read, too, since my findings here aren't shared by many, and because I <em>can</em> speak to learning technical systems at various depths <em>as a process</em>. </p>

      <p>So to start, and since this is my first post on the GitHubz, I guess maybe a little self introduction is in order.  So I've worked for the better part of the last 16 years (since about 1998) on and off in the technology sector at various levels.  I've done it all - desktop support, call center hell, server and network administration, Linux, Windows, MacOS, FreeBSD, project management, participating in new ERP deployments and MRP support - you name it and I've probably broken it and had to fix it. For me, the best way to learn has been by blowing things up and putting them back together. I don't write this to presuppose some knowledge (I at least <em>like to think</em> I'm aware of my own ignorance?).  These experiences, though, have shown me beyond anything else that people process information differently, and that no one process is really better than another. Admittedly, sometimes focusing on one way of learning for too long can get tedious or frustrating, but I'll tell you what - working Help Desk jobs in IT will teach a person <strong>real fast</strong> how to deal with such frustration. Quite honestly, I find facing my own ignorance is far easier (albeit terrifying) than faking it till you get busted. The latter is just not a cool place to be, <strong>and it will eventually happen</strong>.   </p>

      <p>So for me, Learning by Breaking is a devilish process, but it's also one that in my mind separates ways of thinking: rote memorization vs. system comprehension.  Everyone has elements of both in their lives, otherwise how would <em>anyone</em> get anything done? While I pride myself on my ability to comprehend an engineered system, I am truly horrible at keeping a potted plant alive - I will never understand when it's a good time to pull yellow leaves off a plant, or determine <em>why</em> they are yellow to begin with. I've come to accept my role as the Reaper of Kingdom Plantae, but through rote learning I've at least kept a cactus alive for a few years. I've also come to recognize that there's a time for rote memorization and a time for theory and system comprehension. Neither should be looked down upon, because (as I'll explain in my little story below) you'll never get a chance to understand the latter without first practicing the former.</p>

      <p>Undoubtedly, this is a lot of preamble when I should be talking about git, but I guess my point is that there's a way to learn by <em>doing</em> and there's a way to learn by <em>understanding what's going on</em>.  This past week's experience, where the course focused on version control conceptually, git's <em>capacity</em> to track changes (I wouldn't describe what we learned as an explanation of <em>how</em> it tracks changes), and the general utility of using a tool like git by way of GitHub to store code.  Loosely speaking, my take-away from the first week of DBC's remote "Phase 0" curriculum is that it is very focused on the <em>doing</em> portion of learning.  That is, within 2 days we were <em>in</em> git, building repos and enabling files for tracking, pushing them to GitHub, etc. Ironically, I'd been using GitHub at my job for years, and <em>just now</em> realized that I'd been doing it wrong.  You see, while at my old job I'd gotten assigned to manage the development of an iOS application, and had been given access to the consulting company's repo for our application.  Due to Apple's odd licensing scheme for internally developed iOS apps, the process for deployment required me to download the source into Xcode, apply our various licenses (called <em>digital signatures</em> for anyone interested, you can find info <a href="https://developer.apple.com/enterprise/">here</a>), then compiling the source and rolling it into an .ipa file and distributing it to the phones via our 3rd party Mobile Device manager (MDM) <a href="http://www.air-watch.com">AirWatch</a>.</p>

      <p>The core problem here was that we were paying a consulting company to provide us with a finished product - meaning a deployable .ipa file.  I found myself constantly trying to walk our vendor through the enterprise digital signing process - which we'd given them access to - but we could never get them to actually sign the code <em>and store those changes to GitHub</em>. When I'd tried to save changes to the GitHub repo, of course I couldn't - I hadn't been given rights to write to that repo (and for good reason, I can assure you!).  I could walk through the entire repo and view changes, see when certain developers from the vendor made and committed their changes, even follow notes, commit messages (verbose or not), and the dev wiki for that project, but I could not commit changes, or even take part in the development cycle <em>on GitHub</em> - I could read developer logic, but would have to respond to issues over email. What this meant was that I was <strong>always</strong> a third party to the development process, and an extra step/hurdle for the developers to <em>deal with</em>, when I was supposed to be <em>managing</em> the development process. Instead of being actively involved in the process via the tool the devs wanted to use (GitHub) - I became a person devs had to write up emails to re-summarize their work. </p>

      <p>So, the issues I was dealing with were: </p>

      <ol>
      <li>I could not commit changes that I knew I could make to GitHub, because I believed (wrongly) that I needed a level of write access I was not comfortable with.</li>
      <li>I could not actively take part in the development cycle <em>as the cycle was going on</em> through the GitHub tools - commit messages were denied to me (or so I thought), I could not post to the Wiki, nor could I really add to the online documentation, bug report, or update feature requests though the tool the developers watched most.  All I could do was email - which just ended up getting <em>so much</em> lost in translation.</li>
      <li>I could only approach resolving these problems with the tools I had - Google, websites, and books.  The problem with turning to websites, Google, and books is this: <strong>If you don't know how to ask the right question, how can you expect to get the answer you need?</strong>  Alternately, reading through an entire 300 page book <em>hoping</em> to get the answer you want for the specific problem you have has a certain, potentially very small, ROI. <em>Especially</em> if the task you're trying to accomplish is very much tangential to your normal duties.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>I should say this now: It is only after my first week of DevBootcamp experience with GitHub that I am even able to identify #1 and #2 <em>as problems</em>.  Prior to this past week, if I was asked what went wrong with the development process of our iOS app, the best I could do to explain would be, "Email is a terrible medium for developers to interact with project managers during the development process. I can't make the changes I know I can make without having a level of access to the code I'm <em>unwilling</em> to take, because I don't understand the tool or how it works."  Of course, the only way I could deal with my perceived lack of skills was to go to Google, to articles on the web, and to pick up a book. Unfortunately, during my time at that job, Luck wasn't with me and I could not find the very simple instructions I needed to understand how git and GitHub worked.  My employer refused to buy me time with the developers for a training session. When I finally left that job and had <em>time</em> to read books, I started immediately by picking up the <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920022862.do">O'Reilly book on Git</a>.  I'm not on page 130, and I could tell you all about the history of Git, its versatility compared to Subversion or other, earlier, version control tools.  I could tell you all about the hashing technology that Git (specifically) uses to reduce/remove duplicate files, track changes, and manage difference between files (it's actually quite ingenious, but beyond the scope of this entry). What I <em>couldn't tell you</em> was how to solve my stupid problems I'd experienced at my former job.</p>

      <p><strong>The beauty of the DevBootcamp process</strong> is that it is first-and-foremost interested in getting our hands dirty. They get us into the tools we need, and we, as a group or in pairs, learn how to deal with those tools. Within 2 hours of screwing around with GitHub (I use "screwing around" loosely to mean "interacting, messing up, breaking things, fixing them"), and being led by DevBootcamp's excellent videos and instructions - I now realize <em>exactly</em> what I could have done to resolve all our development cycle problems with the Dreaded iOS Application that Shall Not be Named:</p>

      <ol>
      <li>FORK THE CODE!  I <em>should</em> have made my own fork of the code base.  From there, I could have git-added the cert file, made appropriate line-level changes to the file pointing to that cert file, and finished with a simple git commit . and a git push.</li>
      <li>UPDATE WITH COMMIT MESSAGES!  Holy crap.  Had I been able to make appropriate line-level changes that the developers could <em>actually see</em>??  They would suddenly understand what had taken me 2 paragraphs in a random email to describe.</li>
      <li>MAINTAIN DOCUMENTATION WITH SIMPLE MARKDOWN FILES IN THE DOCUMENTS SECTION!!!  Just... ugh.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>It literally <em>kills</em> me to see how simple it all was.  I can sit here and describe to you why git does what it does and how git works at a fairly technical level, thanks to the books I bought. I'm sure, eventually, this knowledge will become useful to me, as I get more involved (and dependent) upon the tool. I'm sure, eventually, I'll come across a bug in git or break something by using it incorrectly.  But the reality is, without the simple, sit-down-and-learn-with-me-you-damn-newbie BootCamp style of mentoring, I'd have only had <strong>luck</strong> determining when the right question for the solution I needed popped into my head. </p>

      <p>Now, after having a few teachers from Bootcamp sit down with me through a virtual YouTube video, and provide me with a few very simple step-by-step instructions on how to work with Git and what each task is accomplishing <em>in a very practical way</em>, I've got my answers. In fact, now that I've actually written this post (which turned out better than I thought it would), I think I'll actually link it to my friends back at the old company, who are almost certainly still struggling with that Godforsaken project.  It just goes to show, even a couple of hours with the mentoring process at DBC could have saved my company literally tens of thousands of dollars, possibly more, and gotten a project off the ground <em>much, much</em> earlier than it did.</p>

      <p>Thank you already, DBC!</p>
