      <p>Stereotype Threat</p>

			<p>I guess the best point to begin this blog entry is to identify myself as a mixed-ethnicity half irish/german, half asian Indian.  More specifically, one half of my family came from the hills of Ohio/Pennsylvania, were generally low-income and low-educated with the exception of my mother, who was the first of her family to go to college, get an MA, and get out what we half-jokingly called "hillbilly country".  Much to the horror of my grandmother, she dated, and later married my dad.  In the American side of my family this caused a great to-do, and led to my mother not speaking with *her* mother for years, until I was born.  When I was born, the first thing from grandma's mouth was "well, he doesn't <em>look</em> too Indian."  I suppose this was meant as a compliment to my mother (and, I'm sure as a snub to my father as she was an incredibly crafty and witty lady), but really, she wasn't lyin'.  The fact of the matter is that for the vast formative years of my life I'd never really felt like I "belonged" anywhere, nor did I ever have a group with which I identified like the other kids seemed to.  I ended up hanging around with a crew of friends that could only be described as the microcosm of the UN.</p>
			<p>Now, this isn't to say I wasn't informed by a perceived identity.  In fact, I'd say I had at least two, very strong, identities, and often these collided.  Here's the rub: when I was younger I'd try to follow the expectations from both sides of the family <em>and</em> and deal with the conflicting perspectives each side had on the other - The Indians found the American side to be under-educated and sometimes ignorant, and treated them with a sort of elitism I'd not seen in the suburbs.  The American side tended towards a more common subtle racism.  With the exception of my Grandma who wanted to be part of her grandchildrens' lives and learned to curb her racism to an extent my dad would tolerate, and her boyfriend Dory, who was just a down-to-earth coalminer with basically <em>*no*</em> ill-will towards anyone of any race (like my grandpa before he died, I hear... I really got along well with Dory), the rest of the American family pretty much shunned my mom and treated my entire family as "the others" whenever we had family hooplahs.  Yes, the irony was almost too much - the white side of my family thought my dad, coming from a third-world country was "after their money" (news flash: they had none)... my dad, coming from an elite class in Indian society of educators, wealthy land-owners, and military struggled with being the second-class citizen to a family of rural poor.</p>
		<p> Well, that's the short version of the backstory, anyway.  Needless to say there was a vast array of stereotypes being slung around my family, which extended to the neighbors, the kids around the block, and pretty much every aspect of my life.  Personally, at a young age I never understood the stereotypes. I'd say more than that, looking back, I actively avoided stereotypes as much as possible and tried to focus on how people acted and what they liked to do - I like to keep it simple, you know?  The reality is, though, that stereotypes - both in-group and out-of-group - have pretty much dominated my life, and I've realized for some time have informed major life decisions one way or another.  I suppose I never had a label for that experience like I do after watching/reading the Stereotype threat topics, but it's not to say I wasn't aware of the influence.</p>
		<p>Of course, being of Indian descent, and having a white mother who worked hard to get an education simply to <em>escape</em> being another coal-miner's wife, I always had extremely high scholastic expectations to bear. While my mother prefered the arts and humanities, dad stressed Math, science, engineering.  Personally I liked telling stories, acting, making jokes - it's how I took the edge off the persistent and overt racism I got to deal with in school on a daily basis.  I also loved cars (still do). Through high school, my science and math teachers always, ALWAYS expected me to score high - one went to the extent of challenging the white kids in class to "beat the asians" (Saad Ahmad, Peter Fang, Julian Cheng, and Raj Singh) on their math tests.  In one regard, there was a sort of pride I felt to be held up to such standards, and I'd make sure I absolutely crushed those tests, but I always had a sense that I was doing it for the wrong reason - I didn't want to excel in math or biology or physics <em>because I was an Indian</em>, I wanted to do it because I <em>could</em>.  There was always a disconnect. Among my asian competition however, boy howdy did we have it out.  Scoring on tests was like a <em>bloodsport</em>.  It was a very odd dynamic.</p>
		<p>Unfortnately, on the other side of the spectrum in the other areas I had an interest - reading and writing, getting up in front of people and acting out a character or making them laugh, or gettting my hands greasy with the industrial arts kids rebulding engines and racing motorcycles - while my mother supported those activities, my relationship with <em>those</em> teachers was far different.  The students in those areas were all white, American, and suburban.  English teachers had their pets, and I was fully aware they had no expectation of me to be capable of writing a solid story with any merit, or care to write good essays on our readings.  They made it clear enough that I was being handed over to the science department, and that I'd best not interfere with their "projects".  Eventually, and for a time, I'd stopped caring in those classes. I could still pull As and Bs, but I knew they were more "gimmies" than actual assessments. It wasn't a proud realization, and I suppose I felt that the humanities were my real <em>way in</em> to a culture and a society that I'd always been separate from.  I mean hell, I was as American as any of those other kids - and <em>probably</em> had more of the "American Experience" than most of them at the same age.  By the time I was 15 I'd already been in a coal mine and actually dug coal, I'd basically been born with a rifle and bows and arrows in my hand (thanks to summering at Grandma's house, which was *awesome*), I'd built go-carts out of old lawn tractor motors and raced them, and I'd been all over the country visiting bits and pieces of my family as the emmigrated from India to the States. Every Summer we'd have to dance and perform for the elders in the hills, and we'd build up a stage and have huge picnics under the stars, and Dory would show me how many animals were watching us by shining this huge flashlight into the trees, making all the racoons' and oppossums' eyes light up.  Every winter we had huge family Christmases because even if they're not Christian, there's one thing Indians like doing - getting the family together, stuffing their faces, and filling their arms with presents.  I'd watch 26 year old cousins who'd never seen snow before go running barefoot into the backyard in sub-zero Chicago winter to "experience it" - only to come a-runnin' back screaming and shivvering, pleading with the little kids to unlock the door and let them back in.</p>
		<p>By the time I got to college (and into a top-tier engineering school at that!), the teenager rebellion had begun.  I still liked cars, but I rejected engineering because it's "what the Indians did".  When the Indian Student Organization at U of I suddenly started asking me to join up, but I refused, explaining that no Indian kids had accepted me before, and I wasn't about to join an org to be called "coconut" and "ABCD"(American-Born-Confused-Desi) for the next four years.  I swapped from the engineering college, refused computer science (at my dad's suggestion), and after bouncing around in various languge departments, and the biology department for a time, ended up fighting my way into the English and Theatre department.  I figured, it was the way to really "get in" to a society I'd at that point believed I was being sheltered from.</p>
		<p> I guess my takeaway from what we'd read about Stereotype Threat sort of feeds my experiences here - I always wanted to get in touch with a culture but had felt like an outsider. In-group demands reinforced the notions that I saw out-of-group, and at some point I became so aware of those stereotypes that I reacted to them (albeit I think in a slightly more self-aware way than what was indicated by Dr. Steele, though I'm sure his reasearch would account for those reactions). To be honest, I'm not srue what was worse - being qualified by people for certain roles in society even while they had NO CLUE who I was, or that very similar stereotypes were being reinforced by people who *did* know me at home.  I suppose looking back, I find the latter more frustrating, and perhaps more insidiously damaging, considering how much effort I put into blending into *any* culture, I was being told by people who <em>knew</em> me that I belong in an entirely different role.  That makes you really question your self-capacity, I have to say.  There's an incredible amount of self-doubt I deal with on a daily basis nowdays, and I swing between fighting desperately for external recognition, and turning completely inward and shutting out the world.  Even at 38 years old. That's something to chew on.</p>
