    	<p>Good Questions get Good Answers</p>

    	<p> Working in IT for the many years I have, I've already come to recognize exactly how important asking the right question is - oftentimes asking a question, most people are only paying half attention to you. Worse, they're looking for keywords and phrases in your question that would essentially link up to something in their own mental indeces.  Sometimes, especially when you really are lost had have *no clue* what you're trying to ask, you'll misuse vocabulary, and trigger the wrong keywords in someone's head - ultimately either leading you to a big FAIL when hoping for a solid answer, or worse, getting even more misdirected.</p>
			<p> It seems to me that in writing Code, this effect is like, TEN TIMES more problematic - code writing is extremely dynamic, made even moreso when you're trying to accomplish something *nobody else in your class or online* has specifically attempted before.  While at the newbie level, this has proven extremely rare (a surprising number of people are pretty shameless about asking for answers to their homework on StackOverflow), I have run into a few intances where the descriptions I've given to Google and to my cohort mates just didn't seem to click. Typically, it was something I was profoundly confused on (iteration through hashes was a doosey a few weeks ago), and I'd either hit them with questions about methods that were *totally unrelated* (now I know) to what I was trying to accomplish.</p>
			<p>I've come up with a short list of good rules for good question-asking:</p>
				<ul>
					<li> Identify two to three keywords for the Pseudocodable Logic you're trying to express: This is mostly relevant for Google, although it helps with fellow coders as well. Basically don't get into overly-long descriptions of what you're doing. They don't need to know the whole nature of your work, and normally you're only really stuck on one bit of logic at a time.  Keep that logic separated in your questions and you'll have more success getting a useful answer.</li>
					<li> Try not to misdirect your mate: Again, this goes along with too much info - don't tell them what you've tried and what you haven't unless they bring something up that you actually <em>have</em>tried.  Otherwise, you'll get explanations galore on why what you did failed (possibly), but you won't get that answer you're looking for on how to make it <em>work.</em></li>
					<li> BE SPECIFIC: Especially in cases where you're going to post on StackOverflow (they're kinda cranky there), don't just say "I want this to do something" - specify exactly what parameters you'd like the result to have.  Typically the most successful questions on SO seem to come from people who write a desired result as though it came from IRB output.  Using the rocketship => <em>desired_result</em> definitely keeps the responders kind.</li>
					<li>Before posting to SO, *please* do your research: A newbie coder really should be able to find an answer with a quality google search - if not for the exact code, then at least for a decent write-up on the theory you're trying to build.  Try things in IRB. Maybe posting what you did in IRB and why the result was not sufficient will help organize someone's understanding of what you're trying to accomplish - heck, it could be as simple an issue of misusing the method syntax.</li>
				</ul>
				<p> Most importantly, be respectful to those to whom you're positing a question. It doesn't help when people feel like they're doing something for you that you should be punished to solve on your own.  "Hello there, my name is X, I had a question on Y concept and am trying to achieve Z." works fairly well. Give people enough context so that they don't have to revisit your post for you to make it more specific - if you're working in JS, tell them. If you're in Ruby, they need to know.</p>
				<p> Ultimately, the success in any field is contingent on your ability to communicate well - even if you're the loaner that's only searching the web for answers your ability to understand how *other* people think when they're trying to answer questions will guide you well.</p>
