      <p>Sexism and the Public vs Private Sphere - Problems in Tech</p>
      <p>October 12, 2014 - by Raj Singh</p>

      <p>So we were asked for this assignment to write on "Issues facing the Tech Industry". Yes, this is incredibly vague - and to be fair my first reaction was to simply write on another tech related topic like standardizing database sets in the Medical industry, or something.  Then I decided to just Google "Issues in tech" and came across <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-biggest-problem-in-technology">this article</a> from the New Yorker.  I was stricken with the level of... wow, just everything: incompetency, capacity to discriminate between public and private spheres, attitudes towards those <em>in</em> the tech industry... just everything.</p>

      <p>I suggest reading the article before reading my response here, but long story short: At a Python programmer's conference, two men in the audience make a bad, obnoxious joke (between themselves, but obviously still within earshot) of a woman, who then turns around, snaps a picture on her cell phone, and sends a public Tweet fully intending to humiliate them.  Next, Internet mob mentality ensues, outrage, guy #1 gets fired. Guy #2 presumably is admonished at his job (whatever that means).  In retaliation, Other-Side-of-Internet-Mob goes on a public firestorm writing absolutely crazy threats to Woman, to the point of performing DDOS attack on her company demanding her dismissal.  Woman's company then fires <em>her</em> stating: </p>

      <pre><code>"Richards' public tweet shaming the pair was disproportionate to the inherent offense in their comments; the pair should not have made an unfunny dick joke - one that has been made too many times already - at a tech conference that emphasizes its diversity and code of conduct..."
      </code></pre>

      <p>First, I feel some self-awareness should be demanded of the author of this article: <em>Perhaps</em> we could stop tempering the attitudes of people working in tech with back-handed comments like "as boring and unremarkable as a gathering of twenty-five hundred programming-language enthusiasts sounds...". Here it's 2014 and every tech has become pervasive through our culture to an almost frightening (as this article shows) degree. Yet still, we're totally fine with continuing the characterture of those in the technology world as dirty, smelly, boring, unimpressive, <em>nerds</em>. Wow. No wonder women aren't interested in joining in the community, and that some in the community responds to <em>any kind of</em> criticism in ridiculously over-the-top, clearly irrational way.</p>

      <p>I'm not by any means defending the craziness that came from the anonymous hordes toward this woman on Twitter, and sadly, would just chalk that up to the unfettered insanity inherent in people when given a semi-anonymous forum combined with the "bravery" they find when mob mentality consumes them. What's <strong>most</strong> sad in this case is that the tech community attacks its own, and worse in this case, one of its few female participants, in an entirely-too-public way. </p>

      <p>That's not to say that she was acting with any sense herself - publicly humiliating <em>anyone</em> making an obnoxious dirty joke (<em>especially</em> between themselves - NOT on stage) is in my mind going <em>way</em> over the top - though I admit I'm totally ignorant of PyCon's behavior policies or what participants agree to going in. (Presumably those kinds of jokes are not considered O.K.) However, I've been to a few conferences in my time, and I have heard some truly horrible and obnoxious things come out of people's mouths (men <em>and</em> women) - I'm just left reminded: "those living in glass houses..."</p>

      <p>At least the author recognizes that in this case <em>nobody</em> acted in any sensible way. Really, I have no idea what the solution is here.</p>

      <p>Personally, I'm a fan of treating everyone like your brother or your sister - be respectful, recognize that everyone else has feelings too, recognize that there's a time and place to be obnoxious and make silly jokes (a professional conference, as much as people would like to think otherwise, are <em>not</em> pubs). <strong>I <em>also</em> like to remind myself from time to time that there's a strong difference between the public and private sphere</strong> - and that most problems are better handled <em>privately</em> if there's even the slimmest chance of success. Publicly shaming people on Twitter is <em>not</em> an appropriate response, to this or <em>mostly anything</em>. </p>

      <p>Personally I think all of this is a result of a culture that is becoming increasingly cowardly, skeptical, and cynical towards anyone or anything external to ourselves - <strong>the idea that "people don't listen or change" is becoming far too prevalent.</strong> The agency of an individual, and an appreciation for our own power to approach someone else and express ourselves <em>privately</em> to that person, seems to be relied on less and less - people seem more willing now to turn to the mob than turn to their own strength.</p>

      <p>I don't know what to think about this situation, except that everyone involved acted stupidly, and the public element just created more grief for everyone involved. Now we're left with a woman who gets threats on Twitter (and became unemployed), two guys (possibly with families) who also found themselves unemployed (and, who will have a hard time finding employment in the future) because of a stupid joke. Worse, the tech community as a whole suffers further cultural characterization as "awkward" and "impersonal", among other things. Wonderful.</p>
