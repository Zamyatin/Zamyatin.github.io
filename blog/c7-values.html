    	<p>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat - Understanding Others</p>
			<p>Raj Singh - November 3, 2014</p>

    				<p> I guess what I'm trying to say here is: If you consistently show that you're trying to Understand Others, that's often all it takes to be viewed as a leader.  Understanding Others requires a few things, but most importantly, to be open to the shared experiences of <em>all people</em>: 1) Honesty (and the anxiety involved with being honest), 2) Finding Balance between their needs, yours, and those of the group, 3) Collaboratively coming to a "What is the Big Picture" consensus - meaning, getting everyone on the same page and understanding our roles in achieving the big picture without it becoming a foreign, outside-of-us goal. Whether I succeed or not, I'm not sure, although some experience from my past job indicates that I've at least learned *something* on the subject.</p>
						
			<p> One often finds oneself in a position of leadership when least expected, and often, when least desired.  Such was the case for me at my last job.  I tend to cling to a meritocratic ethos - those who do the best work should reap a fair reward for their service.  There's a catch though: part of the definition of "good work" must include team values - a "good worker" will contribute to the proserpity of the group and in doing this find personal satisfaction and thereby professional reward.  This believe serves both pragramtically and as a way to englighten the development of my <em>own</em> character.  For example, if I know something someone else doesn't, I'm free to choose what way to serve: a) the interests of the group, b) the interests of my teammate who's struggling, and c) my personal interests.  I can offer to help teach someone something, which earns both reputation and, certainly, some free time away from having to do that task <em>again</em> in the future. </p>
			
			<p> Due to my willingness to teach and learn from my coworkers I earneded a certain reputation among the other employees at my old company -  I was always open to questions from the non-technical and the technical alike without makign that person feel anxious asking a "Stupid question." The reality is, I actually *like* teaching people something new - I get a bit of satisfaction when I see that lost look in their eyes change once something "clicks". More importantly, being approachable means that I can approach someone back, without that same anxiety, and learn about their part in the business - making me a more effective administrator of the technology they use as I learn *how* they use it, and where process could be improved. Eventually I rose up to a positon of leadership among my the IT team.</p>
			
				<p>I think aside from the negative aspects of what was going on in the company, (attrition, which caused people to "bear up" and start withholding information, hoping that would make them less dispensible) my opinion never changed that we should all work together, teach each other, experiment, and learn from outside the IT department as much as we should within it.  People appreciated that, moreso even those who were not part of IT.  Teammates eventually looked to me when they felt pressured to "close off". I found quite a bit of satisfaction in being a bit of a light in the darkness. I reminded people that they're due a right to learn from their job as much as the company is due the right to ask what is needed.  When they felt the scales balanced too far one way or the other, they should make an effort to readjust. I think just being able to identify the pressures and oddities being asked of them, and deal with them in an honest way both to themselves and their managers helped reducing stress, which in turn reduced project apathy (a serious problem at that company) and increased overall efficacy.</p>
			
			<p> Now, I'm 38 years old. I'm about 10 years older than the average age of the majority of my close friends. (I'm not sure how this happened, except that I returned to undergrad colleges a few times for post-BA classes, and did an MS later than most people.) Anyway, the result is I'm actually pretty good at giving advice when I'm not acting like a goof.  My friends I guess, now entering a point in their lives where they're leaving their twenties and moving on to find more permanent jobs, entering corporate life and the like, have started asking me questions and expressing their frustration with everything entering that environment holds.  You act a different way, you interact with people differently, you-can't-be-a-punk-kid-forever kind of issues.</p>
			
			<p> I've got friends now asking me how they approach issues that involve stresses they feel because, plainly speaking, they're not seeing the "Big Picture", and more importantly their role in it.  There's still a sense of entitlement, or perhaps a sense of need for immediate gratification because some of them have become used to it.  The fact of the matter is, once you start working in the corporate world, immediate gratification isn't really the business' concern.  Right now, I have a friend who's just finished getting his MBA from a prestigious school with a rigorous cirriculum.  Now he's just graduated and has decided he wants to go into an analytical role rather than Investment Banking, where most of his schoolmates have gone. He's seeing them find jobs quickly (the turnaround in that field is astronomical, I understand), and he's frustrated that he's struggling to find employment.  Worse, he's being extremely picky about the <em>types</em> of jobs he applies to, and I'd say may be shooting a bit higher than he should be given his experience in corporate America - NASDAQ is not going to pick up a formally trained actor who managed to get through an MBA program, without some proven credentials in financial analysis from *somewhere*.  My advice to him has been consistent - be honest with yourself and your abilities, and don't expect people to go out of their way to serve your needs.  You need to market yourself as someone indespensible to them, but at the same time, do so by understanding *what they want* and *what they're trying to achieve.  I'm trying to reinforce with my friend that a job hunt is not a lone wolf project, he's actually looking for a team to join. Once there, he shouldn't think the team is there to serve <em>him</em>.  In fact, he'll prosper when he learns to serve the team, be honest with his lack of experience, but but express a desire and ability to learn.</p>
			
			<p> Insofar as dealing with Stereotype Threat (as I've come to think about it from last week's readings), I'd actually say that my need to Understand Others really already is a way for me to deal with it.  I've kind of come to the conclusion the last few years that you can't change minds overnight, but over time, if people actually pick up on my desire to connect with them in a productive manner, be honest with them, and show that I actually want to trust them (and earn their trust), perhaps whatever perspective that person holds can be changed.  If I ever decided to go into a management or active leadership role, I can't allow myself to be affected by other's opinions, and I have to remain vigilant that I always *can* be. In fact, as I write this I wonder now whether my decision to this point <em>not</em> to manage at higher levels has been somehow informed by some kind of Stereotype Threat.  What I can say: If I do decide to take leadership roles, being aware of what others think I can and can't do can affect judgement and decisions in ways that I may *not* see, but if I can cling to my belief that if I try really, really hard to understand others, I may at least remain comfortable in the notion that I'm acting and making decisions in a way I can be proud of.</p>
