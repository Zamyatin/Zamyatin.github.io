    <p> If you hate popups, you'll hate this game. I just made this little webpage to test my JS script until the overall game starts to take form.</p>
    <p> You've chased an asteroid heading directly for your planetary colony into a very thick nebula cloud!  Monitors are out, you're blind!</p>
		<p> You know that if you rotate your ship and fire blind, you *should* be able to see the flash from a hit on the asteroid.  You also realize that you can probably blow the asteroid apart enough for it to dissipate into the atmosphere with three hits.</p>
		<p>Position the ship to hit the asteroid.  The asteroid will move clockwise around the ship, and the ship will begin facing a random direction. You will be polled whether you want to rotate the ship clockwise, counterclockwise, or stay in the same position. Shoot the asteroid three times (you will be notified with a "HIT!" confirmation). Once a confirmed "HIT" or "MISS", the asteroid moves to the next position and you will be asked whether to rotate again and fire, or to stay in the same place. To destroy the asteroid  you must hit it three times! Remember, you only have 10 shots! Make them count, captain!</p> 

    <h3> To play:</h3>
    <p> You'll be asked whether you want to [Fire], [Rotate Right], or [Rotate Left].  Choose, but remember that you only have 10 shots in your ammo banks!</p>
